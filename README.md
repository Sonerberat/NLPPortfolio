# NLP Portfolio
# 1. [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://github.com/Sonerberat/NLPPortfolio/tree/main/Named%20Entity%20Recognition%20(NER)%2C%20(Trax)) 
Defining named entity recognition (NER). NER is a subtask of information extraction that locates and classifies named entities in a text. The named entities could be organizations, persons, locations, times, etc. In this project, you will able to see how to:
- Design the architecture of a neural network, train it, and test it.
- Process features and represents them
- Understand word padding
- Implement LSTMs
- Test with your own sentence
# 2. [Sentiment with Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/Sonerberat/NLPPortfolio/tree/main/Sentiment%20with%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks(Trax))
Sentiment analysis is a powerful text analysis tool that automatically mines unstructured data (social media, emails, customer service tickets, and more) for opinion and emotion, and can be performed using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. In this project, you will able to see how to:
- Understand how you can build/design a model using layers
- Train a model using a training loop
- Use a binary cross-entropy loss function
- Compute the accuracy of your model
- Predict using your own input
# 3. Text Message Topics(https://github.com/Sonerberat/NLPPortfolio/tree/main/Text%20Message%20Topics)
Analysing text messages by asking these questions:
- 1. Text message senders from which countries send the longest messages?
- 2. What are some of the most common topics of text messages sent by people from Singapore, India, and the United States? How are they similar, and how are they different?
- 3. How (if at all) did the common topics of text messages sent by people from Singapore change between 2003 and 2011?
- 4. Is it possible to use text message data to predict what country a sender is from?

The rest of this notebook aims to answer these three questions using such tools as word counts, TF-IDF analysis, word embeddings, n-gram identification, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes supervised machine learning model.
